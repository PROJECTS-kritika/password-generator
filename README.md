# password-generator
I developed this project by using python. It helps users create stronger passwords that provide greater security for a given type of access. 
The best thing about creating our own password generator is that we can customize it as we like.
we have created a password generator that asks the length of the password and generates a random password containing digits, alphabets, and special characters.
